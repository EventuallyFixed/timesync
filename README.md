# TimeSync
An incremental backup system for [Western Digital Personal Cloud](https://shop.westerndigital.com/en-gb/c/nas-and-cloud-storage) devices.

# Why
Because the only backup options for these devices are either one-time copies, or online, paid-for services.

# Aim
- To create a user-friendly, and incremental, backup system.
- To use only the software that is bundled with the device.
- To have a mobile friendly, modern, User Interface.

# Inspiration
The excellent [BackInTime](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime) project.
